# Avax 3 Smart Contract Project
The objective of this contract is to be able to write a smart contrct to create our own ERC20 token and deploy it using Remix. This will be submitted for the AVAX PROOF intermediate course assessment. This will show how to implement some functions.

# Description
This smart contract allows the user to utilize or implement the functions **mint()**, **burn()**, and **transfer()** on their smart contracts.

# Content Overview
1. **mint()**: Allows the owner (assumed to be the deployer) to mint new tokens and assign them to a specific address.
2. **burn()**: Allows the owner to burn (destroy) tokens from a specific address.
3. **transfer()**: Allows any token holder to transfer tokens to another address.

# Getting Started
1. Open the source code in REMIX IDE.
2. Compile avax3.sol.
3. Use the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
4. Now use your account address when deploying.
5. Now you can use the features of the Deployed Contracts.
